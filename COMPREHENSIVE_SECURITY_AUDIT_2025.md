## üî¥ CRITICAL VULNERABILITY FINDINGS

### 1. EXPOSED API KEYS AND AUTHENTICATION CREDENTIALS

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**CVSS Score**: 10.0
**Risk**: Complete system compromise, financial loss, data breach

#### üö® Immediate Exposure Risks

**File**: `/home/starlord/OrcaQueen/.env.production`
```bash
# REAL API KEYS WERE PREVIOUSLY EXPOSED IN REPOSITORY (REDACTED HERE)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=<redacted>
GEMINI_API_KEY=<redacted>
GEMINI_API_KEY_ALT=<redacted>
OPENAI_API_KEY=<redacted>
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<redacted>
RAILWAY_TOKEN=<redacted>
HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN=<redacted>
VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN=<redacted>
```

**Additional Exposures**:
- Docker Compose files contain placeholder keys that could be mistaken for real keys
- Multiple deployment files reference exposed environment variables
- Vault root token exposed (allows complete secrets management bypass)

#### Impact Assessment:
- **Financial Risk**: Unlimited API usage on OpenRouter (~$0.10-$15 per 1K tokens)
- **Quota Exhaustion**: Gemini API keys with 50,000 credit limits
- **Infrastructure Compromise**: Railway deployment tokens provide full project access
- **Model Access**: HuggingFace tokens enable model downloads and API access

### 2. WEAK SECRETS MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**CVSS Score**: 9.1

#### Issues Identified:
- **Vault configured but not enforced**: HashiCorp Vault is deployed but applications still read from environment files
- **No key rotation**: Static keys without automated rotation mechanisms
- **Plaintext storage**: Secrets stored in plaintext environment files
- **Missing encryption**: No encryption at rest for configuration data

```yaml
# Evidence from deploy/01-oracle-ARM64-FIXED.yml
environment:
  - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://litellm:{{ with secret "secret/db/password" }}{{ .Data.data.password }}{{ end }}@postgres:5432/litellm
  - LITELLM_MASTER_KEY={{ with secret "secret/litellm/master_key" }}{{ .Data.data.key }}{{ end }}
# ‚Üë Vault integration configured but not used in practice
```

### 3. CONTAINER SECURITY VULNERABILITIES

**Severity**: CRITICAL
**CVSS Score**: 8.9

#### Privilege Escalation Risks:
```yaml
# Multiple services require elevated privileges
thermal-monitor:
  cap_add:
    - SYS_ADMIN  # Full system administration capabilities
  runtime: nvidia

gpu-monitor:
  cap_add:
    - SYS_ADMIN  # Unnecessary privilege elevation
  devices:
    - /dev/nvidiactl:/dev/nvidiactl  # Direct hardware access
```

#### Root User Containers:
- Several containers lack explicit non-root user configuration
- GPU-enabled containers often inherit root privileges
- No runtime security scanning or admission controllers

### 4. NETWORK SECURITY EXPOSURES

**Severity**: HIGH
**CVSS Score**: 8.2

#### Public Interface Bindings:
```yaml
# Services exposed on all interfaces without proper filtering
ports:
  - "0.0.0.0:8000:8000"  # vLLM exposed globally
  - "100.96.197.84:4000:4000"  # LiteLLM with specific IP but no TLS
  - "8080:8000"  # SillyTavern without HTTPS enforcement
```

#### Missing TLS Implementation:
- Internal service communication in plaintext
- No mutual TLS (mTLS) implementation despite configuration
- Missing certificate validation in service-to-service calls

---

## üü° HIGH SEVERITY FINDINGS

### 5. AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION GAPS

**Severity**: HIGH
**CVSS Score**: 7.8

#### Issues:
- **Disabled MFA**: Multi-factor authentication disabled for convenience
- **Weak session management**: JWT secrets exposed in environment files
- **Missing RBAC**: Role-based access control not fully implemented
- **API key validation**: Insufficient validation of API key permissions

```yaml
# From config/security.yml - MFA disabled
authentication:
  open_webui:
    require_2fa: false  # Enable for production ‚ùå
```

### 6. INSUFFICIENT INPUT VALIDATION

**Severity**: HIGH
**CVSS Score**: 7.5

#### Model Safety Concerns:
```yaml
model_safety:
  uncensored_models:
    warning_banner: true  # Warning only, no blocking
  content_filtering:
    enabled: false  # Completely disabled for uncensored operation
```

### 7. AUDIT LOGGING DEFICIENCIES

**Severity**: HIGH
**CVSS Score**: 7.3

#### Missing Coverage:
- API key usage not comprehensively logged
- Failed authentication attempts not correlated
- Administrative actions lack proper audit trail
- Log tampering protections not implemented
