**Mitigation Strategy**: Implement Railway Pro backup services

#### 4. Thermal Management (Thanos Node)
**Risk**: RTX 3080 thermal throttling under load
**Mitigation**: Implemented automatic thermal monitoring and throttling

#### 5. Cost Overrun Potential
**Risk**: API consumption exceeding budgets without proper controls
**Mitigation**: LiteLLM budget controls configured but require testing

### üü¢ MANAGEABLE RISKS

#### 6. Network Latency
**Mitigation**: Tailscale mesh networking optimized for <50ms inter-node latency
